# About Keep-It-Simple-React-Django-App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I basically created this web app to demonstrate the integration of ReactJS with Django backend.

In this app, I've implemented the Django REST framework to send and receive data between the client and server.
